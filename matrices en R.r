# what are the default values?

# possible operations
A^2 the same than  A*A  ,what is it?

   --> it's element times element'

C


C * A  #, why not??  

C %*% A , what is it?    multiplication of matrices
B %*% A

D = C %*% A

det( D) 

C^T  ,is this what I think?
A^T

t(C)  # transp

C^-1  , what have you done?  --> not inverse of the matrix
        multiplicative inverse of each element

(C %*% A )^-1, what is it?

inv( C %*% A) # library(matlib)

solve(D)   # base function in R

solve( A%*%C)

det(A%*%C)

solve( A%*%C) %*% ( A%*%C)   ??????   A * A^-1  -->   I2
